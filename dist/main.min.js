 *
 * Changelog
 * $Date: 2010-12-12 (Wed, 12 Dec 2010) $
 * $version: 1.0.0
 * $version: 1.0.1 - removed multibyte comments
 *
 * $Date: 2011-21-02 (Mon, 21 Feb 2011) $
 * $version: 1.1.0 	- added allowPageScroll property to allow swiping and scrolling of page
 *					- changed handler signatures so one handler can be used for multiple events
 * $Date: 2011-23-02 (Wed, 23 Feb 2011) $
 * $version: 1.2.0 	- added click handler. This is fired if the user simply clicks and does not swipe. The event object and click target are passed to handler.
 *					- If you use the http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/ plugin, you can also assign jQuery mouse events to children of a touchSwipe object.
 * $version: 1.2.1 	- removed console log!
 *
 * $version: 1.2.2 	- Fixed bug where scope was not preserved in callback methods.
 *
 * $Date: 2011-28-04 (Thurs, 28 April 2011) $
 * $version: 1.2.4 	- Changed licence terms to be MIT or GPL inline with jQuery. Added check for support of touch events to stop non compatible browsers erroring.
 *
 * $Date: 2011-27-09 (Tues, 27 September 2011) $
 * $version: 1.2.5 	- Added support for testing swipes with mouse on desktop browser (thanks to https://github.com/joelhy)
 *
 * $Date: 2012-14-05 (Mon, 14 May 2012) $
 * $version: 1.2.6 	- Added timeThreshold between start and end touch, so user can ignore slow swipes (thanks to Mark Chase). Default is null, all swipes are detected
 *
 * $Date: 2012-05-06 (Tues, 05 June 2012) $
 * $version: 1.2.7 	- Changed time threshold to have null default for backwards compatibility. Added duration param passed back in events, and refactored how time is handled.
 *
 * $Date: 2012-05-06 (Tues, 05 June 2012) $
 * $version: 1.2.8 	- Added the possibility to return a value like null or false in the trigger callback. In that way we can control when the touch start/move should take effect or not (simply by returning in some cases return null; or return false;) This effects the ontouchstart/ontouchmove event.
 *
 * $Date: 2012-06-06 (Wed, 06 June 2012) $
 * $version: 1.3.0 	- Refactored whole plugin to allow for methods to be executed, as well as exposed defaults for user override. Added 'enable', 'disable', and 'destroy' methods
 *
 * $Date: 2012-05-06 (Fri, 05 June 2012) $
 * $version: 1.3.1 	- Bug fixes  - bind() with false as last argument is no longer supported in jQuery 1.6, also, if you just click, the duration is now returned correctly.
 *
 * $Date: 2012-29-07 (Sun, 29 July 2012) $
 * $version: 1.3.2	- Added fallbackToMouseEvents option to NOT capture mouse events on non touch devices.
 * 			- Added "all" fingers value to the fingers property, so any combination of fingers triggers the swipe, allowing event handlers to check the finger count
 *
 * $Date: 2012-09-08 (Thurs, 9 Aug 2012) $
 * $version: 1.3.3	- Code tidy prep for min version
 *
 * $Date: 2012-04-10 (wed, 4 Oct 2012) $
 * $version: 1.4.0	- Added pinch support, pinchIn and pinchOut
 *
 * $Date: 2012-11-10 (Thurs, 11 Oct 2012) $
 * $version: 1.5.0	- Added excludedElements, a jquery selector that specifies child elements that do NOT trigger swipes. By default, this is .noSwipe
 *
 * $Date: 2012-22-10 (Mon, 22 Oct 2012) $
 * $version: 1.5.1	- Fixed bug with jQuery 1.8 and trailing comma in excludedElements
 *					- Fixed bug with IE and eventPreventDefault()
 * $Date: 2013-01-12 (Fri, 12 Jan 2013) $
 * $version: 1.6.0	- Fixed bugs with pinching, mainly when both pinch and swipe enabled, as well as adding time threshold for multifinger gestures, so releasing one finger beofre the other doesnt trigger as single finger gesture.

 *                       Removed the a, input, select etc from the excluded Children list as the 0 distance tap solves that issue.
 * $Date: 2016-05-19  (Fri, 29 April 2016) $
 * $version 1.6.17     - Fixed context issue when calling instance methods via $("selector").swipe("method");

 * 
 * $Date: 2018-09-17  (Mon, 17 September 2018) $
 * $version 1.6.19     - replaced jQuery bind with on, replaced deprecated `navigator.pointerEvents` with `window.PointerEvents`

  * The default configuration, and available options to configure touch swipe with.
  * You can set the default values by updating any of the properties prior to instantiation.
  * @name $.fn.swipe.defaults
  * @namespace
  * @property {int} [fingers=1] The number of fingers to detect in a swipe. Any swipes that do not meet this requirement will NOT trigger swipe handlers.
  * @property {int} [threshold=75] The number of pixels that the user must move their finger by before it is considered a swipe.
  * @property {int} [cancelThreshold=null] The number of pixels that the user must move their finger back from the original swipe direction to cancel the gesture.
  * @property {int} [pinchThreshold=20] The number of pixels that the user must pinch their finger by before it is considered a pinch.
  * @property {int} [maxTimeThreshold=null] Time, in milliseconds, between touchStart and touchEnd must NOT exceed in order to be considered a swipe.
  * @property {int} [fingerReleaseThreshold=250] Time in milliseconds between releasing multiple fingers.  If 2 fingers are down, and are released one after the other, if they are within this threshold, it counts as a simultaneous release.
  * @property {int} [longTapThreshold=500] Time in milliseconds between tap and release for a long tap
  * @property {int} [doubleTapThreshold=200] Time in milliseconds between 2 taps to count as a double tap
  * @property {function} [swipe=null] A handler to catch all swipes. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:swipe}
  * @property {function} [swipeLeft=null] A handler that is triggered for "left" swipes. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:swipeLeft}
  * @property {function} [swipeRight=null] A handler that is triggered for "right" swipes. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:swipeRight}
  * @property {function} [swipeUp=null] A handler that is triggered for "up" swipes. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:swipeUp}
  * @property {function} [swipeDown=null] A handler that is triggered for "down" swipes. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:swipeDown}
  * @property {function} [swipeStatus=null] A handler triggered for every phase of the swipe. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:swipeStatus}
  * @property {function} [pinchIn=null] A handler triggered for pinch in events. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:pinchIn}
  * @property {function} [pinchOut=null] A handler triggered for pinch out events. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:pinchOut}
  * @property {function} [pinchStatus=null] A handler triggered for every phase of a pinch. See {@link $.fn.swipe#event:pinchStatus}
  * @property {function} [tap=null] A handler triggered when a user just taps on the item, rather than swipes it. If they do not move, tap is triggered, if they do move, it is not.
  * @property {function} [doubleTap=null] A handler triggered when a user double taps on the item. The delay between taps can be set with the doubleTapThreshold property. See {@link $.fn.swipe.defaults#doubleTapThreshold}
  * @property {function} [longTap=null] A handler triggered when a user long taps on the item. The delay between start and end can be set with the longTapThreshold property. See {@link $.fn.swipe.defaults#longTapThreshold}
  * @property (function) [hold=null] A handler triggered when a user reaches longTapThreshold on the item. See {@link $.fn.swipe.defaults#longTapThreshold}
  * @property {boolean} [triggerOnTouchEnd=true] If true, the swipe events are triggered when the touch end event is received (user releases finger).  If false, it will be triggered on reaching the threshold, and then cancel the touch event automatically.
  * @property {boolean} [triggerOnTouchLeave=false] If true, then when the user leaves the swipe object, the swipe will end and trigger appropriate handlers.
  * @property {string|undefined} [allowPageScroll='auto'] How the browser handles page scrolls when the user is swiping on a touchSwipe object. See {@link $.fn.swipe.pageScroll}.  <br/><br/>
                    <code>"auto"</code> : all undefined swipes will cause the page to scroll in that direction. <br/>
                    <code>"none"</code> : the page will not scroll when user swipes. <br/>
                    <code>"horizontal"</code> : will force page to scroll on horizontal swipes. <br/>
                    <code>"vertical"</code> : will force page to scroll on vertical swipes. <br/>
  * @property {boolean} [fallbackToMouseEvents=true] If true mouse events are used when run on a non touch device, false will stop swipes being triggered by mouse events on non touch devices.
  * @property {string} [excludedElements=".noSwipe"] A jquery selector that specifies child elements that do NOT trigger swipes. By default this excludes elements with the class .noSwipe .
  * @property {boolean} [preventDefaultEvents=true] by default default events are cancelled, so the page doesn't move.  You can disable this so both native events fire as well as your handlers.
